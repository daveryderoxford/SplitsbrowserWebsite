          The Splits Graph highlights time loss on individual legs and allows split times to be
          compared between runners.
          <p>The X axis shows a representative total time for each control. The Y axis shows the
          competitor's cumulative time lost compared to a specified optimum time. The optimum time
          may be: <br>

          time for the leg (the default)<br>

          <p>The Race Graph is a real-time view that identifies who was running with who and how
          groups form and split up as the race progresses.</p>
          <p>The X axis shows a representative total time for each control. The Y axis shows the
          competitors total time minus the optimum time at each control. This view is not available
          if the results do not contain start time data.</p>
          <p>A popup window (left or right mouse button) displays all competitors passing through a
          control two minutes either side of the current mouse position.</p>

          <p>When only one runner is selected the 'Crossing runners' button is enabled. This
          automatically selects all runners that passed or were passed by the selected runner.</p>

    <h3 id="CourseClass">Course/Class selection</h3>
    <p>The class to view may be selected from the class dropdown. Other classes running the course
    are displayed in the course checkbox next to the class dropdown. These may be included in the
    displayed results by single clicking on them.</p>

    <h3 id="RunnerAnnotation">Runner annotation</h3>
    <p>The runner annotation is displayed to the right of the both the splits and race graph. It
    identifies the runner by name and optionally includes the following data for the selected
    control:<br>
    <img src="images/arrow_small.gif" width="6" height="11" valign="top" alt=""> total time to
    control and position<br>
    <img src="images/arrow_small.gif" width="6" height="11" valign="top" alt=""> split time for the
    leg and leg position<br>
    <img src="images/arrow_small.gif" width="6" height="11" valign="top" alt=""> time behind the
    fastest time<br>
    <img src="images/arrow_small.gif" width="6" height="11" valign="top" alt=""> loss for leg
    calculated as below<br>
    The checkboxes to the bottom right of the window select the data values to display in the annotation.</p>

    <p><i>Time Loss calculation</i></p>
    <p>The time loss for each leg is estimated as follows:<br>
    1. Calculate competitors rate of time loss for each leg compared the fastest time on the course
    for the leg. <br>
    (split(leg) - fastest(leg)) / fastest(leg) <br>
    2. Find the median leg time loss rate for the competitor. Using the median means it will not be
    influenced by large losses or short legs. <br>
    3. Using this median loss rate calculate the target time for each control. <br>
    4. Calculate loss based on this target time. <br>
    </p>

    <h1 id="HowDoI"">How do I</h1>

    <p><b>Q - How long did I lose at control 3?</b><br>
    A - In <a href="#SplitsView">Splits View</a> check that the 'Time loss' checkbox is selected in
    the bottom right. Select your class and result and place the cursor on the required control. The
    time loss is displayed in the <a href="./mainhelp.shtml#RunnerAnnotation">runner annotation</a>
    to the right of the graph. The time loss is the last entry in the annotation.</p>

    <p><b>Q - How does my run compare to my mates?</b><br>
    A - In <a href="#SplitsView">Splits View</a> selecting both runners will give a direct
    comparison. At any control the line on top will be the one that is ahead at that point. For each
    control the line that slopes upwards more will be the faster split. For a more accurate
    comparison use your time as the optimum by selecting 'Any runner' in the 'Compare with' and then
    selecting yourself in competitor dropdown. Now your line will be horizontal. Any faster splits
    than you will slope upwards and any slower ones downwards.</p>

    <p><b>Q - Who has the fastest run-in split both overall and in my class?</b><br>
    A - In <a href="#SplitsView">Splits View</a> place the mouse to the right of the 'Finish' leg.
    Pressing the left mouse button will give the fastest competitors in your class. Pressing the
    right button will display the fastest competitor in each class with the same last control.</p>

    <p><b>Q - How long had I taken up to number 6?</b><br>
    A - In <a href="#SplitsView">Splits View</a> check the 'Total time' checkbox on the bottom of
    the graph. The runner annotation to the right of the graph will nor show the total time
    immediately after the name. Move the move the mouse to the required control to display the total
    time for the required leg.</p>

    <p><b>Q - Who was running with me between controls 2 and 3?</b><br>
    A - In <a href="#RaceView">Race View</a> clear all current selections and then select yourself.
    Pressing the 'Crossing runners' button will select all runners that you passed/were passed by
    you. Deselecting runners much slower then you will expand the scale if required.</p>

    <p><b>Q - Who was that stunning blond/rugged M21 that I saw at control 2.</b><br>
    A - In <a href="#RaceView">Race View</a> select yourself, place the mouse pointer at control two
    at your time and press the left mouse button. The pop-up will display all competitors 2 passing
    the control within 2 minutes of you.</p>
